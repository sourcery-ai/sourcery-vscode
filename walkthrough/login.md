### Opting Into Sourcery's Coding Assistant

There are two main ways you can use Sourcery as a pair programmer. One is through our rules-based in-line suggestions that run fully locally and that you'll see appear in your code. The other is through our Coding Assistant which you can ask questions to, can write new code or update your existing code, and more. The Coding Assistant relies on third party large language models and you need to opt into using it before you can start. 

To opt into use the Coding Assistant, open the Sourcery sidebar, and click the Opt In button. If you choose not to opt in, you can still use the rules-based suggestions from Sourcery fully locally
