## In-Line Suggestions
In addition to interacting with Sourcery through chat or through recipes and code lenses, Sourcery will also passively review your code and make suggestions to improve your code quality, readability, and maintainability.

In Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript files you'll start to see Sourcery underline sections of your code where it has a reccomendation. You can hover over these underlined pieces of code to see the suggestion Sourcery is proposing.

### Accept a Suggestion

To accept a suggestion you can:

- Press the quickfix shortcut (typically `Ctrl .` or `Cmd .`) when you have
  selected the underlined line and then choose to apply the refactoring
- Click on the lightbulb icon next to the underlined line and then select to
  accept the refactoring
- Open the Problems pane, right click on the suggested refactoring, and accept
  the suggested change.

### Skip a Suggestion

You can skip a Sourcery suggestion once by choosing the skip option from the
Sourcery action items menu:

- Press the quickfix shortcut (typically `Ctrl .` or `Cmd .`) when you have
  selected the underlined line and then choose to skip the refactoring
- Click on the lightbulb icon next to the underlined line and then select to
  skip the refactoring
- Open the Problems pane, right click on the suggested refactoring, and select
  to skip the refactoring.

You can also tell Sourcery not to suggest all refactorings or a specific type of
refactoring for a function.

- Add a comment `# sourcery skip` to a function to skip all reactorings for that
  function
- Add a comment `# sourcery skip: <refactoring-id>` to a function to skip the
  specific refactoring in that function. A full list of refactorings and their
  IDs are available at [Current Refactorings](https://docs.sourcery.ai/refactorings/index.md).


### Permanently Ignore a Type of Refactoring

You can choose to never see a certain type of refactoring when it is suggested
to you by Sourcery. Bring up the Quick Fix menu and select the third menu item
`Sourcery - Never show me this refactoring`.

Sourcery will then add this refactoring to your list of
[excluded refactorings](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Configuration/Customizing-Refactorings/). You can
reverse this by going to your project's sourcery.yaml file and removing the
refactoring from the `skip` list.

### See Code Quality Metrics

Sourcery gives each of your functions a quality score on 4 different metrics:

- **Complexity**
- **Method Length**
- **Working Memory**
- **Overall Quality**

To see the metrics for any function, simply hover your mouse of the line
defining the function and the Sourcery metrics will pop up. Each metric will
have a numeric score, along with a quick qualitative guide ranging from bad to
excellent.

Sourcery will also automatically flag functions with too low of an overall
quality score. By default this is set for functions with a quality score under
25%, but you [can adjust this threshold](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Configuration/).
