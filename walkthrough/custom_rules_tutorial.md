# Writing your first custom rules

By the end of this tutorial you will have written two custom Sourcery rules and
used them to review your code.

## Introduction

Have you ever seen the same code smell come up again and again in different code
reviews? Wouldn't it be great if you could write a rule to make sure that it
could never happen again?

Sourcery can be extended with your own custom rules that allow you to do this.

## Creating your first rule

Open or create `.sourcery.yaml` in your IDE and paste your first rule:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: raise-not-implemented
    description: NotImplemented is not an Exception, raise NotImplementedError instead
    pattern: raise NotImplemented
```

Save this file, then open a new Python file and paste this problematic code:

```python
class ExampleBaseClass:
    def abstract_method(self):
        raise NotImplemented
```

Sourcery highlights the line where this issue occurs. Hover your mouse on the
highlight to see the problem:

![NotImplemented Comment](NotImplemented-Comment.png)

## Including a replacement in your rule

This is really nice, but what would be even nicer is to have Sourcery fix this
for you. Update your `.sourcery.yaml` rule by adding a `replacement` key:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: raise-not-implemented
    description: NotImplemented is not an Exception, raise NotImplementedError instead
    pattern: raise NotImplemented
    replacement: raise NotImplementedError
```

Save this file, return to the example code and hover over the highlight:

![NotImplemented Suggestion](NotImplemented-Suggestion.png)

Not only is the issue highlighted but the fix is suggested too!

Let's accept the suggestion:

1. Move the cursor to the broken code, this will show the lightbulb ðŸ’¡
2. Click the lightbulb to show Sourcery options
3. Select the first option

and Sourcery fixes our code:

![NotImplemented Fixed](NotImplemented-Fixed.png)

Congratulations, you've written your first rule!

## Dissecting a rule

Let's look closer at our rule:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: raise-not-implemented
    description: NotImplemented is not an Exception, raise NotImplementedError instead
    pattern: raise NotImplemented
    replacement: raise NotImplementedError
```

Firstly, we can see that our rule lives inside a `rules` sequence. This can
contain multiple rules as we'll see later on.

Each rule has the following keys:

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id          | string | Required | Unique, descriptive identifier, e.g. `raise-not-implemented`   |
| description | string | Required | A description of why this rule triggered and how to resolve it |
| pattern     | string | Required | Search for code matching this expression                       |
| replacement | string | Optional | Replace the matched code with this                             |

## More powerful patterns using captures

Let's take it up a level. Add a second rule to `.sourcery.yaml`

```yaml
rules:
  - id: raise-not-implemented
    description: NotImplemented is not an Exception, raise NotImplementedError instead
    pattern: raise NotImplemented
    replacement: raise NotImplementedError

  - id: remove-open-r
    description: Files are opened in read mode `r` by default
    pattern: open(${file}, "r")
    replacement: open(${file})
```

The new feature here is that we are now using the capture `${file}` to match any
code that is used as the first argument to `open`. This captured code is then
used in the replacement.

Paste this code into your example file to see this in action:

```python
def print_sourcery_yaml():
    with open(".sourcery.yaml", "r") as f:
        print(f.read())
```

Now hover over the highlighted line:

![Hover remove open r](RemoveOpenR-Hover.png)

Here we can see that `${file}` has captured `"sourcery.yaml"` and used it in the
replacement.

Finally use the quickfix lightbulb to fix your code.

![Fixed remove open r](RemoveOpenR-Fixed.png)

Beautiful!

## Conclusion

You've written two rules; one that matches exact code, and a second that
captures code to reuse it in the replacement.

Now go forth and write your own rules. Enjoy!
